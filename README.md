# Scoreboard

Try it [here](https://jgpaiva.github.io/scoreboard).

A very simple online scoreboard. Made for mobile and to be used un fullscreen. Has minimal functionality and zero configuration.
I built this mostly to solve my own problem of not wanting to deal with apps with ads or sites with lots of configuration.

Built as a single html page (index.html) with all the markup, css, and javascript in it. It has no tests, because I don't know how to test this. It'll likely not work in all browsers, since I only tested it on the devices I needed this to work. PRs are welcome.

If you'd like something more configurable, try [score count](https://scorecount.com/).
